# Proofing Gallery

Proofing Gallery is a native Nextcloud app for branded client delivery and
collaborative photo proofing. A gallery either references an existing Nextcloud
folder or assembles an ordered virtual collection from several owned galleries.
Originals remain in Files while the app adds a customizable public presentation,
guest feedback, selections, secure downloads, and an upload inbox.

## Included

- presentation and collaborative proofing modes
- standard Nextcloud public-link protection, password, and expiry
- responsive image/video gallery with nested folders, previews, lightbox,
  slideshow, zoom, pan, and byte-range video streaming
- bounded FFmpeg background transcoding for camera formats, with browser-ready
  H.264/AAC MP4 derivatives, generated posters, and administrator controls
- optional owner search over local filenames and metadata, plus scene search
  through an explicitly enabled HTTPS vision provider
- optional HTTPS Live Push ingestion through upload-only, gallery-scoped
  credentials that can be rotated or revoked independently; camera-protocol
  translation is deliberately left to an operator-managed gateway
- administrator-approved custom gallery domains with DNS ownership and HTTPS
  verification, immediate revocation, and canonical link generation
- logo, hero image/focal point, accent, typography, welcome copy, filenames,
  and server-rendered preview watermarks
- likes, color states, comments, image annotations, named selections, and
  CSV/plain-text exports
- individual downloads, selected ZIP files, and printable contact sheets
- resumable guest uploads to a hidden moderation inbox
- user/group gallery managers, activity filters, and opt-in event digests for
  owners and individual managers
- reusable gallery and invitation templates plus explicit German/English
  public-gallery and mail delivery
- ordered, copy-free collections spanning the owner's folder galleries, with
  unavailable-source diagnostics and conflict-safe editing
- bounded EXIF/IPTC indexing through Nextcloud FilesMetadata, with owner-side
  capture date, camera, lens, keyword, and rating filters
- per-gallery public metadata disclosure that starts with no shared fields and
  permanently excludes GPS, private keywords, ratings, and workflow labels
- direct Adobe-compatible `<basename>.xmp` editing for titles, descriptions,
  creators, copyright, keywords, ratings, and labels while originals stay intact
- client-selection round trips into standard XMP/Lightroom fields and a
  versioned Proofing Gallery namespace for workflow fidelity
- recursive, cursor-paged galleries with folder/type grouping and bounded
  virtual grids for large photographic deliveries
- a keyboard-first owner culling desk with ratings, picks/rejects, color labels,
  conflict-aware XMP synchronization, batch undo, and cross-device saved views
- multiple independently scoped public links per gallery, each with its own
  start folder, presentation mode, language, download and feedback policy
- volume-event deliveries that combine shared folders with exactly one private
  participant folder per link, including CSV assignment, optional PINs and
  encrypted recipient contact data without copying originals
- private per-client star ratings and decisions, owner-side aggregates, and an
  explicit preview-before-promotion workflow that never writes XMP implicitly
- a field-selectable, privacy-bounded UTF-8 CSV export composer with preview and
  clipboard support, plus configurable resource-aware slideshows

## Local development

Requirements: Docker with Compose, Node.js 24.11 or newer, npm 11, PHP 8.1 or
newer, and Composer 2.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
nvm use
npm ci
composer install
make dev-up
```

Nextcloud is available at <http://localhost:8080> and Mailpit at
<http://localhost:8026>. The credentials in `.env.example` are local-only.

```bash
make build
make docs
make lint
make test
npm run test:e2e
make test-compat
make occ CMD="app:list"
make dev-logs
make dev-down
```

`make dev-reset` deletes only this Compose project's containers and volumes,
including all local development data, and requires `CONFIRM_RESET=yes`.

## Packaging

```bash
make appstore
make verify-package
```

The reproducible unsigned artifact is written to
`build/artifacts/appstore/proofing_gallery.tar.gz`. Signing credentials are
deliberately not stored in this repository. Maintainers should follow the
[App Store publishing runbook](docs/APPSTORE-PUBLISHING.md) for certificate
registration, signed package verification, and protected release automation.

### Install a GitHub release

Download `proofing_gallery.tar.gz` and `SHA256SUMS` from the matching
[GitHub release](https://github.com/soerennb/nextcloud-proofing_gallery/releases).
Verify the checksum and, when the GitHub CLI is available, the artifact
attestation before extracting the archive:

```bash
sha256sum --check SHA256SUMS
gh attestation verify proofing_gallery.tar.gz --repo soerennb/nextcloud-proofing_gallery
tar -xzf proofing_gallery.tar.gz -C /path/to/nextcloud/custom_apps
sudo -u www-data php /path/to/nextcloud/occ app:enable proofing_gallery
```

Starting with the first App Store release, the protected release workflow
publishes the reproducible, Nextcloud-signed package to both GitHub and the
Nextcloud App Store.

## Compatibility

The automated container matrix covers Nextcloud 31–34 with SQLite, MariaDB, and
PostgreSQL. PHP 8.1–8.6 is declared; CI runs the supported baseline and current
PHP versions. Browser E2E coverage uses Chromium and includes Axe accessibility
and desktop/mobile visual regression checks.
